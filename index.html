	<h2>Have you ever thought about starting a career in graphic design or has it been a while since you last worked in the field and you want to refresh your skills?</h2>

<p class="para1" >One of the amazing things that the internet can offer is online courses. Whether you want to learn about graphic design, learn a new language, or even learn how to grow watermelons, chances are there is a resource out there for you to learn how.</p>
<br>

<p class="para2">I know what you’re thinking though. That you don’t have the time. You have a full-time job and a house and kids to take care of and on top of that, you don’t have the extra money laying around to spend on books or materials or to pay for classes, and you definitely do not want to take another student loan to pay for it.</p>
